Test app using :

- Ruby 1.9.2 + Rails 3.0.4
- MongoDB as database and MongoID as mapper
- HAML as the template engine, with some translations in English and Spanish using I18n
- jQuery instead of Prototype to handle the AJAX requests and stuff
- CarrierWave + Fog to process and upload files to the Amazon S3 server
- Delayed Job to run the upload of files asynchronously in the background
