= Test Application

This app was created to test {Ruby 1.9.2}[http://www.ruby-lang.org/], {Rails 3.0.4}[http://rubyonrails.org/] and some of the newest releases of the most useful gems.

NOTE : I am still working on this README file in order to cover all the details related to the test.

== Used Tools

* {Ruby 1.9.2}[http://www.ruby-lang.org/] + {Rails 3.0.4}[http://rubyonrails.org/]
* {MongoDB}[http://www.mongodb.org/] as database and {MongoID}[http://mongoid.org/] as mapper
* {BSON}[http://bsonspec.org/] to accelerate the Ruby BSON serialization, used by {MongoDB}[http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/BSON] as the data storage and network transfer format for "documents"
* {HAML}[http://haml-lang.com/] as the template engine, with some translations in English and Spanish using {I18n}[http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html]
* {jQuery}[http://jquery.com/] + {jquery-ujs}[https://github.com/rails/jquery-ujs] ( jQuery.rails.js ) instead of Prototype to handle the AJAX requests and stuff
* {jQuery Cascade}[http://dev.chayachronicles.com/jquery/cascade/index.html] is a plugin for "jquery" used to handle dependencies between several drop down lists
* {jQuery Lightbox}[https://github.com/krewenki/jquery-lightbox] a quite simple plugin to display nicely the uploaded images
* {CarrierWave}[https://github.com/jnicklas/carrierwave/] + {Fog}[https://github.com/geemus/fog] to process and upload files to the Amazon S3 server
* {MiniMagick}[https://github.com/probablycorey/mini_magick] as the image processing library used by "CarrierWave" to process the uploaded images
* {ImageMagick}[http://www.imagemagick.org/] is used by "MiniMagick" to process the images.
* {Delayed Job}[https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job] + {delayed_job_mongoid}[https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job_mongoid] to run the upload of files asynchronously in the background

== Getting Started

Download and install {Ruby 1.9.2}[http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/], the {MongoDB 1.6.5}[http://www.mongodb.org/downloads] and install the latest gems needed using the "bundle" command :

    [sudo] bundle install

NOTE : Windows users will need to install {DevKit}[http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/] in order to be able to install some gems ( like BSON ), and also need to avoid paths with spaces for the above installations ( believe me, this will save you headaches ).

In order to create the indexes needed by "delayed_job"

    script/rails runner 'Delayed::Backend::Mongoid::Job.create_indexes'

Do not forget to modify the "config/initializers/carrierwave.rb" file with your own "s3_access_key_id", "s3_secret_access_key", and "s3_bucket" in order to give access to "carrierwave" to the Amazon S3 server, and the "config/mongoid.yml" file to fit your database settings.

NOTE : Refer to the "Gemfile", the "config/application.rb" and the "config/routes.rb" files and the "config/locales" folder for extra configurations.

== Quick Start

Lets load some feeds into our database in order to have some data to play with the dependent drop down lists. So lets run :

    rake db:seed

== Getting Help

* Please feel free to contact me for any issue or doubt, but please remember that this is just a test and not a full production app, so wait issues.

* {Trevor Turk}[http://trevorturk.com/] who helped me to solve an issue storing several versions with "CarrierWave" on the "Amazon S3" server on a "Windows" machine ( {Issue 220}[https://github.com/jnicklas/carrierwave/issues/220/] )
